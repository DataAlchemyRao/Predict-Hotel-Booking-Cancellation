## Problem Statement : 
In the past few years, both the City Hotel and Resort Hotel have experienced significant increases in their cancellation rates. As a result, both hotels are currently facing a range of challenges, such as reduced revenue and underutilized hotel rooms. Therefore, the top priority for both hotels is to reduce their cancellation rates, which will enhance their efficiency in generating revenue.

## Goal : 
Build a machine learning model that can predict whether a particular booking which has been done by a user is going to cancel or not.  

## Assumptions :
 1. Between 2015 and 2017, no significant events or unexpected incidents had a substantial impact on the data being considered.
 2. The information remains up-to-date and can be effectively utilized to analyze a hotel's potential strategies.
 3. There are no unforeseen drawbacks to the hotel's adoption of any recommended approach.
 4. The suggested solutions are not currently being implemented by the hotels.
 5. The most significant factor influencing revenue generation is the occurrence of booking cancellations.
 6. Cancellations result in unoccupied rooms for the originally booked duration.
 7. Clients typically make hotel reservations in the same year they subsequently cancel them.

## Suggestions : 
 1. Increasing prices are associated with a higher rate of cancellations. To mitigate reservation cancellations, hotels could refine their pricing strategies by offering 
    reduced rates for specific locations and providing discounts to customers.
 2. The resort hotel experiences a higher ratio of cancellations compared to the city hotels. Therefore, hotels should consider offering competitive room price discounts on 
    weekends and holidays.
 3. During the month of January, hotels can launch marketing campaigns with attractive offers to boost their revenue, especially since cancellations tend to peak during this 
    period.
 4. Enhancing the quality of hotels and their services, particularly in Portugal, can be an effective approach.
